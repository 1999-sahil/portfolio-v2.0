My interest in computers started from my school days, and I was very eager to learn as much as I could about them. I remember my first website that I made years ago, which had aterrible interface and design. The purpose of it was to download movies and stuff like that. It is unfortunate that I don't have the code.

  After this, I became more and more interested in web development and began to find resources to learn more about it. I watched many video tutorials, read through documentation and articles. The first programming language I learned was C, and from there, I also learned Java and C++. In addition to working with programming languages, I have also experimented with databases and have found that Mongo DB  is my favorite so far. I have also used MySql and Firebase few time.
